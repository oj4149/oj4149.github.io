Couch 2048
==========

[*Couch 2048*][0] is a physics-based puzzle, loosely related to the original [*2048*][1] game.

Written by [Mark Vasilkov][2] for js13kGamesâ€“2016.

Compatibility
-------------

Any modern browser should work. <sub>Even MS Edge. Especially MS Edge.</sub>

The game is CPU-intensive, which is why there is the *High Quality* toggle on the title screen.

Kudos
-----

Many thanks to [Marcus Geelnard][3] for the music! Both the [Sonant JS synthesizer][4] and the song were authored by this amazingly talented person.

The Verlet physics engine is heavily inspired by the work of [Gerard Ferrandez][5].

Sound FX code is based on the [blog post][6] by Jack Rugile.

I'm also extremely grateful to Natalia Vasilkov, Michael Reyfman and Amnon Grossman for beta-testing and support.
